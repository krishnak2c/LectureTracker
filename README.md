# LectureTracker

LectureTracker is a web application designed to help Computer Science & Engineering students. It provides a structured way to track progress through video lecture series, breaking them down into manageable daily study plans based on user-defined settings.

The application is live at: [https://cseLectureTracker.vercel.app/](https://cseLectureTracker.vercel.app/)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Study Plan:** Automatically groups lecture videos into daily schedules based on your desired daily study duration and video playback speed.
- **Progress Tracking:** Mark videos as completed and visually track your progress for each day with an animated progress bar.
- **Persistent State:** Your progress and settings (study time, speed, etc.) are saved locally in your browser, so you can pick up where you left off.
- **Customizable Experience:** Adjust daily study hours, playback speed, and the number of days displayed per page.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with modern, animated components using Framer Motion and shadcn/ui for a smooth user experience.
- **Open Source:** The project is open-source and welcomes contributions!

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/krishnak2c/LectureTracker.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd LectureTracker
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application uses JSON data for each subject, containing video lectures and durations. It calculates daily schedules by grouping videos based on your preferred study duration and playback speed. Track your progress with checkboxes; your settings are saved in your browser's `localStorage`.

### Data Structure

The video data for each subject is stored in a separate JSON file inside the `/data` directory (e.g., `/data/cn.json`). To add new subjects or update video lists, you can modify these files. Each JSON file is an array of video objects with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "index": "1",
    "videoLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
    "videoTitle": "Introduction to Computer Networks",
    "videoTime": "45:32",
    "videoDurationInSeconds": 2732,
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/.../hqdefault.jpg"
  }
]
```
